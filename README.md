i3wm is a convenient, minimalistic window Manager that is easy to configure as you wish.
I made a set of installation scripts for easy startup. I use fork i3-gaps instead of pure i3, because it seems more convenient to me. There are also many convenient additions to i3.

clone this repository or download the archive. 
Each script has a number at the beginning of the name. Then launch it .sh scripts in order up to 4_create_config.sh. 
If you want, you can run the script with the number 5, it will install applications for you (Google Chrome, Telegram, Vim, Postman)
